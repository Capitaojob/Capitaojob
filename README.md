I have a degree in System Analysis and Development from UNIP. I continue to expand my skills through external courses and training. I aim to diversify my repertoire, improve my hard and soft skills, and contribute meaningfully to the company I work for.

I have intermediate experience and knowledge in Excel, Word, Photoshop, and Blender as additional tools that can add value to my projects.
