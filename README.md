I am an IT (System Analysis and Development) student at UNIP, complementing my studies with external courses and training in my spare time. I'm looking for work in the area so that i can learn more while continuing my studies in the college, diversify my repertoire, improve my hard and soft skills as a whole and, at the same time, be able to add to the company i will be working for. 

I have intermediate experience and knowledge in Excel, Word, Photoshop and Blender as extra related tools that can add value to the company.
The programming languages I'm studying the most are C, Java, Python and HTML / CSS. 

I also took some courses focused on intra and interpersonal skills, focusing on improving my emotional management and teamwork, with some of my mentors being O Corpo Explica and Murilo Gun. 
Finally, i took and take classes on financial investment and time management, with the mentors Thiago Nigro, Bruno Perini and Wendell Carvalho.
